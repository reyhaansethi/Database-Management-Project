## Project Instructions
DS 220 – Project #2 on Data Analysis with Python – Individual or Team!
Compiled by Dr. Mathias Fonkam (Instructor) – 11/16/23
Project #2 – Data Analysis with Python – An Individual or Team (max 6) Project which you
must each host on your individual Github Account
The broad goal for your Project #2 is to demonstrate some understanding and appreciation for
data analysis using some Python and its growing suite of Data Science libraries with a special
focus on the Pandas library. The Pandas library builds on the NumPy and MatPlotlib libraries. In
particular you are required to:
• Identify a raw public dataset of interest to you and download the raw data to your computer.
• Frame some 6 to 10 Questions that you or others in the area may want to answer analyzing
this data.
• Load your data set into a Pandas data frame and do some preprocessing and cleaning if
needed (this should be documented)
• Perform exploratory data analysis & visualization
• Map your questions as queries on the Pandas dataframe to generate answers
• Derive insight(s) using answers to your questions
• Communicates those insights as actionable text or a story that may be easy to communicate
and share with others interested in the same dataset.
• Publish your work on github pages at a reachable URL
Project Deliverable & Format
Deliverable: URL of your own GitHub Pages site hosting an .ipynb/.html export of your final
tutorial
• https://pages.github.com/ – you need to register and create a GitHub account
• https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3
The project itself:
• ~1500+ words of Markdown prose
• ~150+ lines of Python – addressing your questions
• Accessible as a static webpage – with its own URL
